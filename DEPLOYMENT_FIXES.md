# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Changes Made for Production Deployment

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded localhost URLs
**Files Updated:**
- `public/script.js` - Changed `/submit` and `/check-email` endpoints to use relative URLs
- `public/login.html` - Changed `/login` endpoint to use relative URL
- `public/dashboardfull/dashboard.js` - Replaced all `http://localhost:5000/` with `/` (22 occurrences)

**Why:** Hardcoded localhost URLs prevent the app from working in production. Relative URLs work in both local and production environments.

### 2. Fixed MongoDB Connection
**File:** `app.js`
- Added support for both `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGO_URI` environment variables
- Added validation to ensure MongoDB URI is set before connecting
- Added error handling to exit gracefully if connection fails

**Why:** Ensures the app connects to MongoDB Atlas in production.

### 3. Fixed Session Cookie Settings
**File:** `app.js`
- Changed `secure: true` to `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`
- Added fallback for `SESSION_SECRET` if not set

**Why:** Allows sessions to work in both development (HTTP) and production (HTTPS).

### 4. Added Error Handling
**File:** `app.js`
- Added try-catch block to `/check-email` endpoint
- Added proper error responses with status codes

**Why:** Prevents crashes and provides better error messages to users.

### 5. Added dotenv to Dependencies
**File:** `formmongo/server/package.json`
- Added `"dotenv": "^16.4.5"` to dependencies

**Why:** Required for loading environment variables from `.env` file.

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\hackmategit\HackMate
git add .
git commit -m "Fix production deployment issues - replace localhost URLs with relative paths"
git push
```

### 2. Verify Render Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Render dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - A random secret string
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`

### 3. Redeploy on Render
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
- Wait for the build to complete

### 4. Test Your Live Site
Visit: https://hackmate-3.onrender.com/
- Test signup form
- Test email checking
- Test login
- Test dashboard features

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
❌ Frontend trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000`
❌ MongoDB connection failing (wrong env var name)
❌ Session cookies not working in production
❌ Missing error handling causing crashes
❌ `dotenv` package not installed

### After:
✅ All API calls use relative URLs (work in any environment)
✅ MongoDB connects using correct environment variable
✅ Sessions work in both dev and production
✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
✅ All dependencies properly installed
